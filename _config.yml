          This is my Master Thesis Work and probably the project that best highlights my skills.

          This work is aimed to address powerline cable's detection to guarantee the safe navigation of drones. Wire's detection has been modelled as an image segmentation task.
          I designed and implemented a Deep Neural Network that solves the problem. 
          I used Python and TensorFlow low-level api to customize training loop and Network Layer's operations.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project is Python/Tensorflow implementation of the Siamese Network at https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09549, used to solve [Template Matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_matching)
          problem with a Machine Learning approach.           
          I experimented with success TensorFlow [tf.Function](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function) to improve performances.

          This application performs [Template Matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_matching)
          using OpenCV algorithms for similarity measures.
          It has a pretty GUI implemented with Qt Framework.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my time at Tor Vergata I learnt most of my key skills:
          - Programming and Design Software following well known standard and patterns of Software Engineering 
          - Knowledge (and great interest) for Machine Learning algorithms both from a mathematical 
          and implementation point of view.
          - Love for Teamwork
